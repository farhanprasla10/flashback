# flashback

In this project, we will build an interactive flashcard app that tells the story of React and its role in the web industry. We'll call it "Flashback". When it's done, you can use it to capture other stories and ideas too!

 To develop this application you need React and ES6, you'll need to load the following libraries into the project t0:

1.Babel
2.React
3.ReactDOM
